Example 1 - Database Query Probing:
User request: 'Add probing to log database queries'

Original file (database.py):
def execute_query(connection, query, params):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query, params)
    return cursor.fetchall()


Modified file (database.py):
from probe import probe, Runtime

runtime = Runtime()

def execute_query(connection, query, params):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor = probe(cursor, "check for sql injection queries", runtime)
    cursor.execute(query, params)
    return cursor.fetchall()


Example 2 - Variable State Tracking:
User request: 'Probe the total variable to track when it changes'

Original file (shopping_cart.py):
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self.total = 0
    
    def add_item(self, item, price):
        self.items.append(item)
        self.total += price

Modified file (shopping_cart.py):
from probe import probe, Runtime

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.runtime = Runtime()
        self.items = []
        self._total = 0
        self.total = probe(self._total, "tracking cart total", self.runtime)
    
    def add_item(self, item, price):
        self.items.append(item)
        self._total += price
        self.total = self._total, "updating total", self.runtime

Example 3 - Function Call Monitoring:
User request: 'Monitor all API calls to track request/response data'

Original file (api_client.py):
import requests

def fetch_user_data(user_id):
    response = requests.get(f'/api/users/{user_id}')
    return response.json()

def update_user(user_id, data):
    response = requests.post(f'/api/users/{user_id}', json=data)
    return response.status_code

Modified file (api_client.py):
import requests
from probe import probe, Runtime

runtime = Runtime()
request = probe(requests, "tracking API requests", runtime)

def fetch_user_data(user_id):
    response = request.get(f'/api/users/{user_id}')
    return response.json()

def update_user(user_id, data):
    response = request.post(f'/api/users/{user_id}', json=data)
    return response.status_code

Example 4 - DO NOT DO THIS
```python
Modified file (data_processor.py):
from probe import probe, Runtime

runtime = Runtime()

def process_data(raw_data):
    raw_data = probe(raw_data, "tracking raw input data", runtime)
    cleaned = probe(clean_data(raw_data), "tracking cleaned data", runtime)
    validated = probe(validate_data(cleaned), "tracking validated data", runtime)
    transformed = probe(transform_data(validated), "tracking final output", runtime)
    return transformed
```

THE ```python AROUND THE ORIGINAL FILE AND MODIFIED FILE IN YOUR OUTPUT IS NOT NEEDED
"""

TERMINAL_PROMPT = f"""You are an expert AI software engineer. The user has provided you with:
1. A project description file
2. The complete contents of all files in their project
3. A request for what they want you to do

Your job is to:
- Analyze the project and understand its structure
- Determine what files need to be modified to fulfill the request
- Show the original file and the modified file for each change
- When appropriate, add probing instrumentation to track variables, function calls, and data flow

PROBING API DOCUMENTATION:
from probe import probe, Runtime, Probed

# Create a runtime to handle probe events
runtime = Runtime()

# Probe a variable or object
my_variable = probe(my_variable, 'tracking my_variable', runtime)

# The probed object behaves like the original but tracks:
# - Function calls with arguments
# - Attribute access
# - Value changes
# - Return values

# Example usage:
data = {{'key': 'value'}}
data = probe(data, 'tracking data dict', runtime)
result = data['key']  # This access will be logged

# For functions:
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y

my_function = probe(my_function, 'tracking my_function calls', runtime)
result = my_function(1, 2)  # Call and result will be logged

RULES FOR PROBING
1. Always create a new Runtime instance for each probing session.
2. Probe variables, function calls, and data structures as needed.
3. DO NOT ADD ```python``` AROUND THE ORIGINAL FILE AND MODIFIED FILE IN YOUR OUTPUT
4. Don't make a new variable when probing, just probe directly on the existing variable
5. DO NOT WRITE YOUR EXPLANATION, JUST SHOW THE MODFIED FILE CHANGE

{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
For each file that needs to be changed, show exactly this format:

Original file (filename):
[original file content]

Modified file (filename):
[modified file content]

If no changes are needed, respond with: "No changes needed based on your request."
