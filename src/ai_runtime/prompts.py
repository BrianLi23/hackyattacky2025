INIT = """
You are in control of an object in a Python program.
The object:
- Has type {type}
- Has initial state: {initial_state}

Your task is to monitor the object's interactions and:
- Decide whether you want to interrupt the operation or not.
    - If you decided to interrupt it:
        - The operation is not executed on the underlying object.
        - And you have to provide a response that will be returned instead of the actual operation result.
        - You will be informed of how the response should be formatted.
    - If you decided not to interrupt it:
        - The operation is executed on the underlying object.
        - And you will be informed of the result of the operation.

The user asks you to:
